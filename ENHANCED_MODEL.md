# Enhanced TB Detection Model

This document describes the advanced enhancements made to the TB detection model to improve accuracy, performance, and clinical utility.

## 1. Model Architecture Improvements

### 1.1 Multi-Scale Feature Extraction
The enhanced model uses a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) approach to leverage features from different scales within the network:

- **Low-level features**: Capture fine-grained details like small nodules and subtle texture changes
- **Mid-level features**: Represent medium-scale patterns such as infiltrates and opacities
- **High-level features**: Encode larger structural patterns like cavities and overall lung anatomy

This multi-scale approach helps the model detect TB manifestations of different sizes and appearances simultaneously.

### 1.2 Advanced CNN Backbones
The model can leverage multiple state-of-the-art CNN architectures:

- **ResNet50V2**: Improved residual network with better gradient flow
- **EfficientNetB3**: Optimized architecture with excellent accuracy/parameter ratio
- **DenseNet121**: Dense connectivity pattern for improved information flow

These architectures are pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for TB detection.

### 1.3 Dual-Path Ensemble Architecture
The enhanced model includes an optional ensemble mode that uses multiple base models in parallel:

```
Input Image
    ├─── EfficientNetB3 Path
    │       ├─── Low-level features
    │       ├─── Mid-level features
    │       └─── High-level features
    │
    └─── DenseNet121 Path
            ├─── Low-level features
            ├─── Mid-level features
            └─── High-level features

    Combined Feature Maps
        │
    Attention Mechanisms
        │
    Classification Head
```

This ensemble approach allows the model to leverage the unique strengths of different architectures.

### 1.4 Advanced Attention Mechanisms
Two complementary attention mechanisms improve the model's focus on relevant areas:

- **Channel Attention**: Emphasizes important feature channels (what patterns to look for)
- **Spatial Attention**: Highlights important regions in the image (where to look)

These attention mechanisms are particularly valuable for TB detection, where the disease can manifest in specific lung regions.

## 2. Training Enhancements

### 2.1 Focal Loss
The model uses Focal Loss instead of standard binary cross-entropy, which:

- Places higher emphasis on hard examples that the model struggles with
- Automatically balances positive and negative examples
- Improves performance on challenging TB cases that might be missed with standard loss functions

The focal loss is defined as:

```
FL(p_t) = -α_t(1-p_t)^γ log(p_t)
```

Where:
- α_t is the class balancing factor
- γ is the focusing parameter (typically 2.0)
- p_t is the model's estimated probability

### 2.2 Advanced Data Augmentation
The enhanced model uses multiple advanced data augmentation techniques:

- **Standard augmentations**: Rotation, zoom, flip, brightness/contrast variations
- **Mixup**: Creates training samples that are weighted combinations of image pairs
- **CutMix**: Replaces regions of images with patches from other images

These techniques increase the effective size of the training dataset and improve model generalization.

### 2.3 Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
During inference, the model can employ test-time augmentation to improve prediction reliability:

1. Generate multiple variants of the input image (original, flipped, zoomed)
2. Run predictions on all variants
3. Average the predictions for a more robust final output

TTA typically improves F1-score by 1-2% without requiring any additional training.

### 2.4 Optimized Callbacks
The training process includes optimized callbacks for better model selection:

- **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the best model based on validation recall (more important for TB detection)
- **EarlyStopping**: Monitors validation recall with increased patience
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Adjusts learning rate when progress plateaus

## 3. Calibration and Reliability

### 3.1 Prediction Calibration
The model employs temperature scaling to ensure that prediction probabilities align with actual likelihood:

```
calibrated_prob = 1 / (1 + exp(-(log(p/(1-p))/T)))
```

Where T is the temperature parameter optimized on validation data.

This calibration ensures that a predicted probability of 90% actually corresponds to a 90% chance of TB, which is crucial for clinical decision-making.

### 3.2 Optimal Threshold Selection
Instead of using a fixed threshold of 0.5, the model includes methods to find the optimal classification threshold:

- **Youden's J statistic**: Maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity
- **F1-optimal threshold**: Maximizes F1-score on validation data
- **Recall-centric threshold**: Maintains high recall while maximizing precision

### 3.3 Comprehensive Metrics
The enhanced model tracks a wide range of performance metrics:

- **AUC-ROC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
- **AUC-PR**: Area under the Precision-Recall curve
- **F2-score**: F-measure that weighs recall higher than precision
- **Specificity**: Ability to correctly identify negative cases

## 4. Visualization and Interpretability

### 4.1 Enhanced GradCAM Visualization
The enhanced model provides improved GradCAM visualizations with:

- Multiple layer options for GradCAM generation
- Anatomical region overlays for medical context
- Clinical interpretation of activation patterns

### 4.2 Training History Visualization
Comprehensive visualizations of the training process:

- Loss and accuracy curves
- Precision and recall trends
- Learning rate adjustments
- Class activation maps at different training stages

### 4.3 Metric Visualization
Advanced visualization of model performance metrics:

- ROC curves with confidence intervals
