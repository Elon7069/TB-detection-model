        ### TB Radiological Patterns
        
        Common patterns seen in TB chest X-rays:
        
        1. **Primary TB:**
           - Lower or middle lung zones
           - Unilateral patchy consolidation
           - Lymphadenopathy common (hilar/mediastinal)
        
        2. **Post-primary (Reactivation) TB:**
           - Apical and posterior segments of upper lobes
           - Superior segments of lower lobes
           - Cavitation common (thick-walled)
           - Satellite lesions and bronchogenic spread
        
        3. **Miliary TB:**
           - Diffuse, uniformly distributed nodules (1-3mm)
           - Both lungs affected symmetrically
           - May be associated with lymphadenopathy
        
        4. **Tuberculoma:**
           - Well-defined nodule or mass
           - May show central calcification
           - Usually upper lobes, can be multiple

    # Tab 3: About Federated Learning

        st.markdown("""
        ### What is Federated Learning?
        
        Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that enables training models across multiple 
        decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging the data itself.
        This is particularly valuable for healthcare data, which is sensitive and private.
        
        ### How it works in this TB Detection system:
        
        1. **Local Training**: Each hospital trains the model on its local chest X-ray data
        2. **Model Aggregation**: Only model weights (not patient data) are sent to a central server
        3. **Weight Averaging**: The central server aggregates the models (FedAvg algorithm)
        4. **Model Distribution**: The improved model is sent back to all hospitals
        5. **Iteration**: This process repeats for multiple rounds until the model converges
        
        ### Benefits for TB Detection:
        
        - **Privacy Preservation**: Patient X-rays never leave their respective hospitals
        - **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps meet HIPAA and other healthcare data regulations
        - **Wider Data Access**: Model learns from diverse populations without data sharing
        - **Better Performance**: More training data leads to more robust models
